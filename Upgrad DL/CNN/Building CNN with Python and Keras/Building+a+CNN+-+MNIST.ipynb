Note that the kernels have only one channel since the input images are 2D (grayscale). By default, a convolutional layer uses stride of 1 and no padding, so the output from this layer is of shape 26 x 26 x 32, as shown in the summary above (the first element `None` is for the batch size).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Layer-2 (Conv2D): We have used 64 kernels of size (3, 3), but this time, each kernel has to convolve a tensor of size (26, 26, 32) from the previous layer. Thus, the kernels will also have 32 channels, and so the shape of each kernel is (3, 3, 32) (and we have 64 of them). So we have 64 x 3 x 3 x 32 (weights) + 64 (biases) = 18496 parameters (all trainable). The output shape is (24, 24, 64) since each kernel produces a (24, 24) feature map.\n",

    "- The `Flatten` layer simply takes in the (12, 12, 64) output from the previous layer and 'flattens' it into a vector of length 12 x 12 x 64 = 9216.\n",
    "\n",
